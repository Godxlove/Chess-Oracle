The dataset is collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess 

# EDA 

In the github the analysis file contains the exploratory analysis and some visualization to understand the data visually.

# Models

We have used 10 supervised machine learning models to evaluate the prediction and metric AUC score. 
Among all the models CatBoost model perform better with 78% of AUC score
