# Chess-Oracle

This project is being developed by a team of three members: Aryan Majhi, John Abraham Chandy, and Meenu Hani.

# Objective 

Predict the white winner in a chess game on the basis of first move of white player and response of black player. In the dataset all the set of moves are given but We choose to predict the white winner the first move.Also it predicts the next move of the player using deep learning techniques

# Data

The dataset is collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess 

# EDA 

In the github the analysis file contains the exploratory analysis and some visualization to understand the data visually.

# Models

We have used 10 supervised machine learning models to evaluate the prediction and metric AUC score. 
Among all the models CatBoost model perform better with 78% of AUC score
